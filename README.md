# Barabasi-Albert network model

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Barabasi-Albert model for generating scale-free networks, as well as some analysis on the degree distributions and visualizations of the generated networks.

This work is created as part of a group exercise in the Complex Networks module in Semester 1 of the Physics of Complex Systems Master at IFISC.
