# Barabási-Albert network model

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Barabási-Albert model for generating scale-free networks, as well as some analysis on the degree distributions and visualizations of the generated networks.

This work is created as part of a group exercise in the MFS3 11003 Complex Networks module in Semester 1 of the Physics of Complex Systems Master at IFISC, UIB.
